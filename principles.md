# Principles
## 1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery
* Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.
* Be honest, but relentless. Change doesn’t happen overnight, it takes time. Stay focused and make the change a priority.
* Remove internal impediments that prevent the customers’ satisfaction from being the highest priority.
* Identify opportunities for delivering working solutions incrementally.
* Know thy customer. Engage with them regularly and define “value” together.
* Create feedback loops! Circle back with customers to ensure satisfaction and course correct when satisfaction has not been achieved. 

## 2. Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process
The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
* Focus on short term goals without losing sight of the long-term vision.
* Planning is vital, but a plan can be worthless. Only plan for what’s in front of you. If the landscape changes, it will be easier and quicker, to pivot.
* Engage the customer frequently. It’s easier to know what changes should, or should not be implemented when there’s a common understanding of what the customer desires.
* Make sure stories are written such that they encompass all phases of software delivery.
* Ensure teams have all of the skill-sets needed to deliver end-to-end working software.
* Seek to understand the customer and the terrain in which the customer operates. This will help navigate changes to enable the customer’s competitive advantage.


3. Frequent delivery of working software – Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.
4. Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project – Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.
5. Support, trust, and motivate the people involved – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.
6. Enable face-to-face interactions – Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.
8. Agile processes to support a consistent development pace – Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.
9. Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility – The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.
10. Simplicity – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.
11. Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs – Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
12. Regular reflections on how to become more effective – Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.
