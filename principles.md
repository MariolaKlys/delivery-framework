# Principles
## 1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery
Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.
* Be honest, but relentless. Change doesn’t happen overnight, it takes time. Stay focused and make the change a priority.
* Remove internal impediments that prevent the customers’ satisfaction from being the highest priority.
* Identify opportunities for delivering working solutions incrementally.
* Know thy customer. Engage with them regularly and define “value” together.
* Create feedback loops! Circle back with customers to ensure satisfaction and course correct when satisfaction has not been achieved. 

## 2. Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process
The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
* Focus on short term goals without losing sight of the long-term vision.
* Planning is vital, but a plan can be worthless. Only plan for what’s in front of you. If the landscape changes, it will be easier and quicker, to pivot.
* Engage the customer frequently. It’s easier to know what changes should, or should not be implemented when there’s a common understanding of what the customer desires.
* Make sure stories are written such that they encompass all phases of software delivery.
* Ensure teams have all of the skill-sets needed to deliver end-to-end working software.
* Seek to understand the customer and the terrain in which the customer operates. This will help navigate changes to enable the customer’s competitive advantage.


3. Frequent delivery of working software – Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.
4. Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project – Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.
5. Support, trust, and motivate the people involved – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.
6. Enable face-to-face interactions – Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.
8. Agile processes to support a consistent development pace – Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.
9. Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility – The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.
10. Simplicity – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.
## 11. Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs
Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
* Give the power to the people! Hold teams accountable to what they say they can and cannot do and then empower them to be successful. Lead instead of direct.Teams will have valuable insight into solutions they have, or currently are, creating. Include them in conversations early and often.
* De-centralise decision making by empowering teams to make all necessary decisions quickly and iteratively to avoid delays in delighting the customer.
* Focus on up-playing the strengths of team members and ensure each team collectively has the skill-sets needed to accomplish the work. Value delivered > organisational structure.
* In adherence with agile principles #1, #2, #3, and #10, it's important to move away from pre-defined project plans. Iterating on the work requires frequent participation from teams and inevitably will result in better solutions. 
## 12. Regular reflections on how to become more effective
Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.
* Introduce retrospectives! Build in a minimum of two hours between projects (or even better, between iterations/sprints) for teams to come together and reflect.
* Set ground rules for retrospectives, and stand by them! Identify working agreements that create safety and trust  encouraging candid communication within the team boundary.
* Task your scrum master with keeping retrospectives interesting, engaging, and productive.
* Embrace and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. Some of the greatest innovations and most iconic people in history were born out of failure.
* Capture action items that come out of retrospectives and track the progress and completion of them. Teams will quickly see which things are being addressed (and which aren't).
