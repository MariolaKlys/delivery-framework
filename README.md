# Delivery Framework
This framework is to outline the approach to delivery for NHS Digital.  It is complementary to and complemented by the software engineering quality framework (https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework)

It aims to:
1. Describe a shared (across multiple teams) definition of "good" delivery
2. Provide tools for teams to gain insight into their current delivery maturity levels
3. Provide resources to support teams to increase their delivery maturity levels

# Philosophy
The main philosophies underpinning this framework are derived from the agile manifesto LINK.  This provides four core values and twelve principles

## Values
1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
2. Working software over Comprehensive Documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

## Principles
1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery – Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.
2. Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process – The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.
3. Frequent delivery of working software – Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.
4. Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project – Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.
5. Support, trust, and motivate the people involved – Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.
6. Enable face-to-face interactions – Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress – Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.
8. Agile processes to support a consistent development pace – Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.
9. Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility – The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.
10. Simplicity – Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.
11. Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs – Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.
12. Regular reflections on how to become more effective – Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.
