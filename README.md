# Delivery Framework
## Purpose
This framework is to outline the approach to delivery within NHS Digital.  It is complementary to and complemented by the [software engineering quality framework](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework)

It aims to:
1. Describe a shared (across multiple teams) definition of "good" delivery
2. Provide tools for teams to gain insight into their current delivery maturity levels
3. Provide resources to support teams to increase their delivery maturity levels

## Philosophy
The main philosophy underpinning this framework is derived from the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).  This includes four core values and twelve core principles:

1. Valuing Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
2. Producing working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Collaborating with our customer over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

More details on the values and principles and how they should be implemented are at these links:
+ [Delivery Values](values.md)
+ [Delivery Principles](principles.md)

## Delivery Models
At the links below are details of good delivery models for single or multiple teams based on using specific agile methods.  It is expected that all delivery teams in NHS Digital follow one of these models.  They are based on industry best practice, tailored for the environments in which NHS Digital operates.
