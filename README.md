# Delivery Framework
## Purpose
This framework is to outline the approach to delivery within NHS Digital.  It is complementary to and complemented by the [software engineering quality framework] (https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework)

It aims to:
1. Describe a shared (across multiple teams) definition of "good" delivery
2. Provide tools for teams to gain insight into their current delivery maturity levels
3. Provide resources to support teams to increase their delivery maturity levels

## Philosophy
The main philosophies underpinning this framework are derived from the [agile manifesto] (https://agilemanifesto.org/).  This includes four core values:
1. Valuing Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
2. Producing working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Collaborating with our customer over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan
