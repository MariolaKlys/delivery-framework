Inputs: 

Team’s Board (physical or electronic) 

Every team member must be present & on time 

Timeboxed to 15 minutes maximum – usually by  the DM / Scrum Master but anyone can monitor 

Select a team member to act as the host for walking the board 

Outputs: 

A shared understanding of progress across the team’s work in progress and a commitment of further progress / completion on each ticket, including any blockers 

An opportunity to ask for help to move a ticket to the next column, by sharing knowledge or working together 

A share understanding across the team on ticket progress 

Car park list (optional) 

 

Car Park 

This is a list, collected by the team during the previous day or as the team talk about a ticket where a promise of a conversation is required. During the stand-up, any team member can suggest this become a car park item, if the conversation becomes too details, so returning the team’s attention back to the tickets on the board & keeping the flow & value of the stand-up meeting. 

Car park items may need the whole team but some may only need a few. How and when they are actioned is a team decision. 

 

Walking the board process 

A member of the team hosts the session & walks the team through the board, starting with any expedite tickets, followed by those tickets being closest to be completed (on the right of the board). 

Each team member involved with the selected ticket should cover:  

What needs to be done to move it to the next column? 

If they need any help? 

Is it blocked and who owns the block? 

This approach focuses on the work which is being completed by the team, making this a team event & is always a safe space to speak openly.

What is a Daily Scrum? 

Learn About the Daily Scrum Event 

As described in the Scrum Guide, the purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work. 

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers. 

The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management. 

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings. 

The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work. 

Inspection and Adaption at the Heart of Scrum 

The Developers use the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the Development Team will meet the Sprint Goal. Every day, the Developers should understand how it intends to work together as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint. Team members often meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions, or to adapt, or replan, the rest of the Sprint’s work. 

Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Team’s level of knowledge. This is a key inspect and adapt meeting. 

The structure of the meeting is set by the Developers and can be conducted in different ways if it focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal.  

The Role of the Scrum Master During the Daily Scrum 

The Scrum Master ensures that the meeting happens, but the Developers are responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The Scrum Master teaches them to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box. 

The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Scrum Team. If others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.
