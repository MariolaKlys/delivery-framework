# Using scrum for a single team in NHS Digital

## Summary
The details in this section are designed to provide an example good delivery model using scrum for a single team.  It is tailored to account for the specific circumstances around delivery in NHS Digital (NHSD).

## Why?
Delivery in NHS Digital uses Agile, a set of principles and values relating to product development.  This provides more flexibility for adapting to changing situations and can  provides value to a customer far quicker than using a traditional Waterfall method which provides a single drop of high value late in the overall lifecycle.  The graph shown below compares the delivery of value over time and shows how having working product gaining feedback from users at an earlier stage also reduces the level of risk.  This feedback allows for adaptation of the delivered product based on what a customer deems important.  It avoids lengthy up front requirement gathering in favour of beginning to deliver workable product.

The biggest difference between Agile and Waterfall is that typically in Agile the deliverable is produced and accepted incrementally.  The model detailed in this section is based on this approach.

## What?
Two artifacts in scrum provide details of what the team will be producing.

Product backlog: The product backlog is a prioritized features list containing every desired feature or change to the product. Note: The term “backlog” can get confusing because it’s used for two different things. To clarify, the product backlog is a list of desired features for the product. 

Sprint backlog: The sprint backlog is a list of tasks to be completed in a sprint.

## Where?
The members of the team will typically be co-located when in the office but if not, suitable collaboration tools should be put in place to assist with working together.  

## Who?
Scrum team: A typical scrum team has between five and nine people, but Scrum projects can easily scale into the hundreds. However, Scrum can easily be used by one-person teams and often is. This team does not include any of the traditional software engineering roles such as programmer, designer, tester or architect. Everyone on the project works together to complete the set of work they have collectively committed to complete within a sprint. Scrum teams develop a deep form of camaraderie and a feeling that “we’re all in this together.”

Product owner: The product owner is the project’s key stakeholder and represents users, customers and others in the process. The product owner is often someone from product management or marketing, a key stakeholder or a key user.

Scrum Master: The Scrum Master is responsible for making sure the team is as productive as possible. The Scrum Master does this by helping the team use the Scrum process, by removing impediments to progress, by protecting the team from outside, and so on.

## How?
In Scrum we have a series of events.  How these should be conducted in NHSD is detailed in the separate links.  The events are designed to foster collaboration among team members with different skillsets to complete work items from the product backlog.  Completion of work is achieved once it conforms to a definition of 'done' on which the whole team has agreed in advance.
Teams work in Sprints, a timebox of work no longer than a month.  Typically these are 1-4 weeks in length.

[Sprint planning](planning.md) At the start of each sprint, a sprint planning meeting is held, during which the product owner presents the top items on the product backlog to the team. The Scrum team selects the work they can complete during the coming sprint. That work is then moved from the product backlog to a sprint backlog, which is the list of tasks needed to complete the product backlog items the team has committed to complete in the sprint.

[Daily Scrum](daily-scrum.md) Each day during the sprint, a brief meeting called the daily scrum is conducted. This meeting helps set the context for each day’s work and helps the team stay on track. All team members are required to attend the daily scrum.

[Sprint review](review.md): At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrates the completed functionality at a sprint review meeting, during which, the team shows what they accomplished during the sprint. Typically, this takes the form of a demonstration of the new features, seeking to gather feedback and inform the next planning sessions. The meeting must not become a task in itself nor a distraction from the process.

[Sprint retrospective](retros.md) Also at the end of each sprint, the team conducts a sprint retrospective, which is a meeting during which the team (including its ScrumMaster and product owner) reflect on how well Scrum is working for them and what changes they may wish to make for it to work even better.
